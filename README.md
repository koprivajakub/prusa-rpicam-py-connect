# Raspberry Pi Camera Connector to the Prusa Connect

This is a software project I created for the Raspberry Pi camera installation into the original Prusa Enclosure.

See the original project page at [Printables](https://www.printables.com/en/model/989624-prusa-enclosure-raspberry-pi-camera-modification) for more details.

Currently tested and supproted Raspbian:
- `bookworm arm64`

Feel free to create fork and contribute to the repository via Pull Requests.
Areas that are welcomed:
- Unit Tests (as I wanted to release and help quickly to others the tests are missing at the moment)
- Other Raspberry Pi distributions (tested only on my environment)
- Other boards and cameras support e.g. `ESP32` etc.
